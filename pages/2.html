        We now have our simple login in place and users could sign into the Pizza0 application. It does look very generic though and lacks the official Pizza branding. Also, individual customers often use Social Sign-In to access the service which the service
        doesn't support at the moment as well. Let's change that!

            In the Auth0 dashboard (manage.auth0.com), navigate to "Branding" -> "Universal Login" in the sidebar menu. There, enter the logo of Pizza0 as well as the primary and background color specified. You can find all this information in your project under
            "styleguide.md" or <a href="https://github.com/urmade/Auth0-B2B-SaaS-Lab/blob/master/styleguide.md">here</a>.

            To enable a Social Login, navigate to "Authentication" -> "Social" in the sidebar menu. Google should already be listed as a provider here. To add another social network, click on "Add" and choose one of the social networks presented. Preferrably choose
            one that you have an account with to test the login afterwards. Choose your preferred provider and follow the guidance to enable it.
            <br><br>Note: You don't have to enter a client ID and client secret right now as we are just testing this feature. In production deployments, we would always recommend setting your own client ID and client secret.

            To activate your new social provider for the application, open the Social Providers menu, go to "Applications" and turn on the application you have registered before. When you now try to authenticate again (follow Step 2) you will be able to use your
            social provider to access the application.
