    <section id="overview">In order to set you up for success, we need a few things in place before we can start:

    <section id="auth0" class="list">

        <div class="content">
            Please register a new tenant on https://auth0.com. You won't need to provide anything but an email and a password, which will give you a free Auth0 tenant with a 3 week enterprise trial enabled (which includes features we will use throughout the lab).
            We would recommend to set up the tenant in the Europe region.

    <section id="lab" class="list">

        <div class="content">
            If you are following an instructor-led training, you should have received an AWS Cloud9 environment which already contains the complete lab environment.
            <br><br> Otherwise Make sure you have <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> Version 16 or higher installed and a code editor ready. We will use Visual Studio Code for the live coding, but any other editor that you feel comfortable with
            should be good as well. Lastly make sure you have cloned the <a href="https://github.com/urmade/Auth0-B2B-SaaS-Lab">lab repository</a> to your local machine.

        Once you are set up, feel free to start with the first lab around integrating Auth0 into your application.
