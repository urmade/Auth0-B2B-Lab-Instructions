        In this challenge you will see how easy it is to strengthen the overall security of your application by adding
        multi-factor authentication.
        <br>
        And the best part ... no code required!

            In this first task of Challenge 4, we will enable one of Okta CIC's many factor types (SMS) in your CIC
            tenant. After you complete the steps to configure the factors, you will define the policy for when users
            will be prompted to complete additional authentication steps.

            <h2>Enable MFA</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Switch to the browser tab where you have your CIC management dashboard open.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the left menu panel, expand the Security option.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click Multi-factor Auth
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the Factors section, choose the factors you want to enable with toggles. Any or all of the
                    factors can be enabled simultaneously. For this challenge we will enable phone message as the only
                    factor. When a user attempts to authenticate with your application, they are sent a code via SMS or
                    voice, which they have to enter to complete the transaction.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Click on the Phone Message factor
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Enable the toggle switch in the top right corner (the red box in the screenshot below). You
                            should get a popup message indicating that the "Phone Message is now enabled".
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Return to the previous screen by clicking the Back to Multi-factor Authentication
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Scroll down to the Define Policies section, and for Require Multi-factor Auth click Always
                            to trigger MFA for all logins.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Toggle the Enable Adaptive MFA Risk Assessment to record risk scores for all login
                            transactions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click Save.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You should get a prompt asking "Are you sure you want to continue?". Click Continue.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

        This challenge strengthened the overall security of your application by adding multi-factor authentication.
        Since the application was already integrated with Okta CIC, a second level of authentication was implemented
        based on a policy without requiring any code changes.
