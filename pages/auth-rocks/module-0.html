    <section id="overview">Challenge Overview: Setup Lab Environment
        In this Welcome challenge, you've already been provided with an Okta CIC tenant to provide identity services to
        a custom application. The Okta CIC tenant provides many identity services such as a place to store our users and
        their profiles (i.e. a user store), authentication, multi-factor authentication, etc.

        We will also create an account on the Glitch platform to host the custom application for this lab.

            Please register a new tenant on https://auth0.com. You won't need to provide anything but an email and a
            password, which will give you a free Auth0 tenant with a 3 week enterprise trial enabled (which includes
            features we will use throughout the lab).
            We would recommend to set up the tenant in the Europe region.
