    <section id="overview">Challenge 1 Overview â€“ Single Page Application (SPA) Sign-on<br>
        We will now create a single page application (SPA) in Glitch which will serve as the user interface (UI) for the
        learner. The SPA will leverage Okta CIC for user authentication purposes.

        We will configure the Okta CIC tenant to provide authentication services using OpenID Connect (OIDC) for the
        application.

        When you are done with this exercise you will have a customizable login to the SPA and the ability to view the
        JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) which contain the Access and ID tokens provided by Okta CIC.

            In this first task, we will use the Glitch platform to deploy a custom SPA to serve as the user interface
            (UI) for the learner. Once the SPA has been deployed, we'll move onto the next task where we will leverage
            Okta CIC's management console to set up the SPA in your CIC tenant.
            <h2>Setup Glitch UI Application</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Ensure that you are logged into Glitch
                </li>
                <li>
                    Go to <a href="">https://glitch.com/~authrocks-cic-ui-template</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scroll down and click the Remix your own button to remix the project
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Remixing will give you a copy of the project that you can edit in your account. Glitch will
                            assign a new,
                            randomly generated name to your project, and a Glitch URL. For example:
                            sable-inquistive-honesty
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (Recommended) Change the name of your Glitch application. Click Settings then click Edit
                            Project Details and enter a new PROJECT NAME. Add "ui-" to the front of the generated name
                            so it's clear that this is the UI application.
                        </li>
                        <li>Click Save</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Launch the remixed Glitch application
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            At the bottom of the browser page, click the Preview link then click Preview in a new window
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You will see the application home page with a Log in button that does nothing...for now.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Copy the URL of your Glitch application from your browser
                </li>
                <li>
                    Paste the URL into the <code>glitch_ui_app_url</code> field in the <code>worksheet.json</code>.
                </li>
                <li>Save the worksheet.</li>
            </ol>
            <blockquote>Don't forget to save!</blockquote>
            Congratulations, you have completed task 1.1 by deploying a custom UI application in the Glitch platform.

            Please continue to task 1.2 below to integrate the application with Okta CIC for identity services.
