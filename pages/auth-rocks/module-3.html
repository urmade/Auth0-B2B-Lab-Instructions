        In this challenge, you will update the Glitch UI application so that the API endpoints in the Glitch API
        application can be called.

        You will then configure Okta CIC scopes, roles and permissions in order to issue the necessary OAuth tokens
        required to access the API endpoints.

        Finally, you will validate that users, with the correct access token, can access all of the API endpoints.

                    have the correct permissions.

            Congratulations, you've completed task 3.1.

            Your Glitch application can successfully call the Public and Private APIs.

            In this task, we will add a custom permission (scope) called "authRocks" to the "My AuthRocks API". We will
            then create a custom role called "AuthRocks Access" and assign it our test user. This should allow our test
            user to click the "Access API" button and get a successful response.

            This challenge used a custom API with permission and roles, to add additional information to the token.

            By the end of this challenge, a test user with the appropriate role is able to access all 3 API endpoints.
