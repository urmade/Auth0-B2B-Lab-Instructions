                    Start icon and the Complete icon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click Apply. This completes deployment of the Action.

        Congratulations, you've completed all our challenges!

        Actions are used to customize and extend Okta CIC's capabilities with custom logic. The processes that can be extended in this way are called flows and each flow is made up of one or more triggers In this challenge, you created two custom Actions to decorate access tokens. You then used the visual flow editor to add the Actions to the Login flow with a simple drag and drop motion.
